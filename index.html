    <p>
      Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves
      (/ˈeɪviːz/), characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying
      of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a
      strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size
      from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) common
      ostrich. There are about ten thousand living species, more than half of
      which are passerine, or "perching" birds. Birds have wings whose
      development varies according to species; the only known groups without
      wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which are modified
      forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has
      led to the loss of flight in some birds, including ratites, penguins, and
      diverse endemic island species. The digestive and respiratory systems of
      birds are also uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic
      environments,
      particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, have further evolved for
      swimming. The study of birds is called ornithology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Birds are feathered theropod dinosaurs and constitute the only known
      living dinosaurs. Likewise, birds are considered reptiles in the modern
      cladistic sense of the term, and their closest living relatives are the
      crocodilians. Birds are descendants of the primitive avialans (whose
      members include Archaeopteryx) which first appeared during the Late
      Jurassic. According to DNA evidence, modern birds (Neornithes) evolved in
      the Early to Late Cretaceous, and diversified dramatically around the time
      of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 mya, which killed off the
      pterosaurs and all non-avian dinosaurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many social species pass on knowledge across generations, which is
      considered a form of culture. Birds are social, communicating with visual
      signals, calls, and songs, and participating in such behaviours as
      cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of predators. The
      vast majority of bird species are socially (but not necessarily sexually)
      monogamous, usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for
      years, and rarely for life. Other species have breeding systems that are
      polygynous (one male with many females) or, rarely, polyandrous (one
      female with many males). Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are
      fertilised through sexual reproduction. They are usually laid in a nest
      and incubated by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of
      parental care after hatching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many species of birds are economically important as food for human
      consumption and raw material in manufacturing, with domesticated and
      undomesticated birds being important sources of eggs, meat, and feathers.
      Songbirds, parrots, and other species are popular as pets. Guano (bird
      excrement) is harvested for use as a fertiliser. Birds figure throughout
      human culture. About 120 to 130 species have become extinct due to human
      activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then. Human
      activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction, though
      efforts are underway to protect them. Recreational birdwatching is an
      important part of the ecotourism industry.
    </p>
    <h1>Evolution and classification</h1>
    <hr>
    <div id="div for the bird in p  and in the bird p 2"></div>
    <p>
      The first classification of birds was developed by Francis Willughby and
      John Ray in their 1676 volume Ornithologiae. Carl Linnaeus modified that
      work in 1758 to devise the taxonomic classification system currently in
      use. Birds are categorised as the biological class Aves in Linnaean
      taxonomy.
    </p>
    <p id="p for the bird 4 in the bird in birds in wiki">
      However, an earlier definition proposed by Jacques Gauthier gained wide
      currency in the 21st century, and is used by many scientists including
      adherents to the PhyloCode. Gauthier defined Aves to include only the
      crown group of the set of modern birds. This was done by excluding most
      groups known only from fossils, and assigning them, instead, to the
      broader group Avialae,[11] in part to avoid the uncertainties about the
      placement of Archaeopteryx in relation to animals traditionally thought of
      as theropod dinosaurs.

    <h1>the Anna's hummingbird</h1>
   <hr>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jL8yxW52Axc?si=AFMovn6S__0VSnjf" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>
      is native to western coastal regions of North America. In the early 20th
      century, Anna's hummingbirds bred only in northern Baja California and
      Southern California. The transplanting of exotic ornamental plants in
      residential areas throughout the Pacific coast and inland deserts provided
      expanded nectar and nesting sites, allowing the species to expand its
      breeding range. Year-round residence of Anna's hummingbirds in the Pacific
      Northwest is an example of ecological release dependent on acclimation to
      colder winter temperatures, introduced plants, and human provision of
      nectar feeders during winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      These birds feed on nectar from flowers using a long extendable tongue.
      They also consume small insects and other arthropods caught in flight or
      gleaned from vegetation.
    </p>   

    <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Anna's hummingbird was formally described and illustrated in 1829 by the
      French naturalist René Lesson in his Histoire naturelle des
      Oiseaux-Mouches from a specimen that had been collected in California.
      Lesson placed it in the genus Ornismya and coined the binomial name
      Ornismya anna.
    </p>
  </head>
  <body>

 
<p> Anna's hummingbird is now placed in the genus Calypte that was introduced in 1856 by the English ornithologist John Gould.
  Gould did not explain the derivation of the genus name but it is probably from the Ancient Greek kaluptrē meaning 
  "woman’s veil" or "head-dress" (from kaluptō meaning "to cover"). The specific epithet anna was chosen to honour 
  Anne d'Essling who married the ornithologist François Victor Massena, 3rd Duke of Rivoli. The species is
   monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<hr>
<p>Anna's hummingbirds are 3.9 to 4.3 in (9.9 to 10.9 cm) long with a wingspan of 4.7 inches (12 cm) and a weight range of 0.1 to 0.2 oz 
  (2.8 to 5.7 g).[7] They have an iridescent bronze-green back, a pale grey chest and belly, and green flanks. Their bills are long, 
  straight, and slender. The adult male has an iridescent crimson-red, derived from magenta, to a reddish-pink crown and gorget,
   which can look dull brown or gray without direct sunlight, and a dark, slightly forked tail. Females also have iridescent
    red gorgets, although they are usually smaller and less brilliant than the male.</p>
<p>The male Anna's hummingbird is the only North American hummingbird species with a red crown. Females and juvenile males 
  have a dull green crown, a grey throat with or without some red iridescence, a grey chest and belly, and a dark, rounded tail
   with white tips on the outer feathers.</p>
<p>The male has a striking reddish-pink crown and gorget, which are strongly iridescent and dependent on the angle of illumination 
  and observation by female or male competitor birds.[8] The iridescence results from large stacks of melanosomes in the feather
   barbules, occurring as layers separated by keratin.[8] The barbules reflect incident light in the manner of partially-opened
    Venetian blinds, enabling the iridescence – which varies the head and gorget coloration with the changing angle of light – as
     a coloration advantage for courtship attraction and territory defense.</p>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/AnnasHummingbirdPaloAltoNorvig.jpg/800px-AnnasHummingbirdPaloAltoNorvig.jpg" width="200"<br>
<p>The male's call – scratchy and metallic – is typically used as the bird perches in trees and shrubs.
   Anna's hummingbirds have adapted to urban environments and are commonly seen in backyards and parks, and at feeders and flowering
    plants. Anna's hummingbirds eat flying insects.</p>
<h1>Atlantic puffin</h1>
<hr>
<p>The Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica), also known as the common puffin, is a species of seabird in the auk family. It is 
  the only puffin native to the Atlantic Ocean; two related species, the tufted puffin and the horned puffin are found in the
   northeastern Pacific. The Atlantic puffin breeds in Russia, Iceland, Ireland,[2] Norway, Greenland, Newfoundland and Labrador,
    Nova Scotia, and the Faroe Islands, and as far south as Maine in the west and France in the east.
     It is most commonly found in the Westman Islands, Iceland. Although it has a large population and a wide range, the species has
      declined rapidly, at least in parts of its range, resulting in it being rated as vulnerable by the IUCN. On land, it has the 
      typical upright stance of an auk. At sea, it swims on the surface and feeds on small fish and crabs, which it catches by 
      diving underwater, using its wings for propulsion.</p>
<p>This puffin has a black crown and back, pale grey cheek patches, and a white body and underparts. Its broad, boldly marked 
  red-and-black beak and orange legs contrast with its plumage. It moults while at sea in the winter, and some of the brightly 
  coloured facial characteristics are lost, with colour returning during the spring. The external appearances of the adult
   male and female are identical, though the male is usually slightly larger. The juvenile has similar plumage,
    but its cheek patches are dark grey. The juvenile does not have brightly coloured head ornamentation, 
    its bill is narrower and is dark grey with a yellowish-brown tip, and its legs and feet are also dark. Puffins from northern
     populations are typically larger than in the south and these populations are generally considered a different subspecies.</p>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Puffin_%28Fratercula_arctica%29.jpg/800px-Puffin_%28Fratercula_arctica%29.jpg" width="300">
<p>Spending the autumn and winter in the open ocean of the cold northern seas, the Atlantic puffin returns to coastal areas at the 
  start of the breeding season in late spring. It nests in clifftop colonies, digging a burrow in which a single white egg is laid.
   Chicks mostly feed on whole fish and grow rapidly. After about 6 weeks, they are fully fledged and make their way at night to
    the sea. They swim away from the shore and do not return to land for several years.</p>
<p>Colonies are mostly on islands with no terrestrial predators, but adult birds and newly fledged chicks are at risk of attacks from
   the air by gulls and skuas. Sometimes, a bird such as an Arctic skua or blackback gull can cause a puffin arriving with a beak full
    of fish to drop all the fish the puffin was holding in its mouth. The puffin's striking appearance, large, colourful bill,
     waddling gait, and behaviour have given rise to nicknames such as "clown of the sea" and "sea parrot". It is the official 
     bird of the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador.</p>
<h3>Taxonomy and etymology</h3>
<hr>
<p></p>
<p>The rainbow lorikeet was formally listed in 1788 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin under the binomial name Psittacus moluccanus. Gmelin cited the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon who in 1779 had published a description of "La Perruche à Face Bleu" in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux.[7] The species was illustrated as the "Peluche des Moluques"[8] and as the "Perruche d'Amboine".[9] Gmelin was misled and coined the specific epithet moluccanus as he believed the specimens had come from the Moluccas. The type locality was changed to Botany Bay in Australia by Gregory Mathews in 1916.[10][11] The rainbow lorikeet is now placed in the genus Trichoglossus that was introduced in 1826 by the English naturalist James Francis Stephens.</p>

<h1>Keel-billed toucan</h1>
<hr>
 <p>The keel-billed toucan (Ramphastos sulfuratus), also known as sulfur-breasted toucan, keel toucan, or rainbow-billed toucan, is a colorful Latin American member of the toucan family. It is the national bird of Belize.[3] The species is found in tropical jungles from southern Mexico to Ecuador. It is an omnivorous forest bird that feeds on fruits, seeds, insects, invertebrates, lizards, snakes, and small birds and their eggs.</p>

<h1>Shoebill</h1>
<hr><br>
<p>The shoebill (Balaeniceps rex), also known as the whalebill, whale-headed stork, and shoe-billed stork is a large long-legged wading bird. It derives its name from its enormous shoe-shaped bill. It has a somewhat stork-like overall form and has previously been classified with the storks in the order Ciconiiformes based on this morphology. However, genetic evidence places it with pelicans and herons in the Pelecaniformes. The adult is mainly grey while the juveniles are more brown. It lives in tropical East Africa in large swamps from South Sudan to Zambia.</p>
<div id="div for number 11"></div>
<div id="id for thed div is 4426"></div>
<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<hr>
<p>The shoebill may have been known to Ancient Egyptians but was not classified until the 19th century, after skins and eventually live specimens were brought to Europe. John Gould very briefly described it in 1850 from the skin of a specimen collected on the upper White Nile by the English traveller Mansfield Parkyns. Gould provided a more detailed description in the following year. He placed the species in its own genus Balaeniceps and coined the binomial name Balaeniceps rex.[4][5][6] The genus name comes from the Latin words balaena "whale", and caput "head", abbreviated to -ceps in compound words.Alternative common names are whalebill, shoe-billed stork and whale-headed stork.</p>
<div id="div id is 12"></div>
<h1>Southern cassowary</h1>
<hr>
<p>The southern cassowary (Casuarius casuarius), also known as double-wattled cassowary, Australian cassowary, or two-wattled cassowary, is a large flightless black bird, found in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and northeastern Australia. It is one of the three living species of cassowary, alongside the dwarf cassowary and the northern cassowary. It is a ratite and therefore related to the emu, ostriches, rheas and kiwi.</p>
<p>Presently, most authorities consider the southern cassowary monotypic, but several subspecies have been described.[3] It has proven very difficult to confirm the validity of these due to individual variations, age-related variations, the relatively few available specimens (and the bright skin of the head and neck – the basis upon which several subspecies have been described – fades in specimens), and that locals are known to have traded live cassowaries for hundreds, if not thousands of years, some of which are likely to have escaped/been deliberately introduced to regions away from their origin.</p>

<h1>Bar-throated minla</h1>
<hr id="hr one 1">
<p>The bar-throated minla or chestnut-tailed minla (Actinodura strigula), or
   even bar-throated siva, is a species of bird in the laughingthrush and babbler family
    Leiothrichidae. Traditionally, it has been placed in the genus Minla but is now placed
     in Actinodura.</p><br>
<p>Eight subspecies have been described, of which six are widely accepted. 
  The nominate subspecies, Chrysominla strigula strigula, is found from central Nepal
   through India, southern China and Bhutan. C. s. simlaensis is found in northern India
    and western Nepal, C. s. yunnanensis is found in north-eastern India, southern China,
     northern Burma, Laos and Vietnam, C. s. castanicauda is found in southern Burma and
      western and northern Thailand, C. s. malayana is found in Peninsular Malaysia and
       C. s. traii is restricted to central Vietnam.</p>
<p>The bar-throated minla occupies a range of montane forest habitats from 1,800–3,750 m 
  (5,910–12,300 ft). The species is mainly resident but may move to lower altitudes during
   harsh winters, coming as low as 1,300 m (4,300 ft). Among the forest types it may occur
    in are evergreen broadleaf forest, mixed broadleaf and evergreen forest, pine forest,
     pine or oak and rhododendron forest, rhododendron or bamboo stands.</p>

<P>The diet of the bar-throated minla varies by season; during the summer months it is
   almost exclusively insectivorous, taking beetles, caterpillars and other insects. In 
   the winter months it will also take berries, seeds, and nectar. It will join flocks
    of other babblers and yuhinas in the non-breeding season, and feeds from the canopy 
    down to near the forest floor. Two to four eggs are laid in a cup of grass, bamboo
     leaves, lichen and birch bark.</P>
<h1>Eurasian eagle-owl</h1>
<hr>
<iframe width="200" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N_f59XiXF8s?si=kmaKYQqVJ5aeFt0m" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<P>Eurasian eagle-owls are found in many habitats, but are mostly birds of mountainous
   regions or other rocky areas, often those near varied woodland edge and shrubby areas
    with openings or wetlands to hunt a majority of their prey. Additionally, they
     inhabit coniferous forests, steppes, and other areas at varied elevations that 
     are typically relatively remote. Eurasian eagle-owls are occasionally found 
     amongst farmland and in park-like settings within European cities, even rarely
     within busier urban areas. The eagle-owl is mostly a nocturnal predator,
   hunting for a range of different prey species. Predominantly, their diet is
    composed of small mammals such as rodents and rabbits, but they also prey on
     larger mammals and birds of varying sizes. Other secondary prey can include
    reptiles, amphibians, fish, large insects and other assorted invertebrates.
       The species typically breeds on cliff ledges, in gullies, among rocks, or in
     other concealed locations. The nest is a scrape containing a clutch of 2 - 4
      eggs typically, which are laid at intervals and hatch at different times.
      The female incubates the eggs and broods the young, and the male provides
  food for her, and when they hatch, for the nestlings, as well. Continuing
  parental care for the young is provided by both adults for about five
 months. At least 12 subspecies of the Eurasian eagle-owl are described.</P>
<p>In addition to being one of the largest living species of owl, the Eurasian eagle-owl
   is also one of the most widely distributed.[9] With a total range in Europe and Asia
   of about 51.4 million km2 (19.8 million sq mi) and a total population estimated to
    be between 100,000 and 500,000 individuals, the IUCN lists the bird's conservation 
    status as being of least concern, although the trend is listed as decreasing.
     The vast majority of eagle-owls live in Continental Europe, Scandinavia, Russia
    (which is almost certainly where the peak numbers and diversity of race occurs), 
   and Central Asia. Additional minor populations exist in Anatolia, the northern
    Middle East, the montane upper part of South Asia, China, Korea and in Japan;
   in addition, an estimated 12 to 40 pairs are thought to reside in the United 
    Kingdom as of 2016 (where they are arguably non-native), a number which may be
     on the rise. Tame eagle-owls have occasionally been used in pest control
   because of their size to deter large birds such as gulls from nesting.</p>

<h1>Grey crowned crane</h1>
<hr> 
<p>The grey crowned crane (Balearica regulorum), also known as the African crowned crane,
   golden crested crane, golden crowned crane, East African crane, East African crowned
    crane, African crane, Eastern crowned crane, Kavirondo crane, South African crane
     and crested crane, is a bird in the crane family, Gruidae. It is found in nearly
      all Africa especially in eastern and southern Africa, and is the national
       bird of Uganda.</p>
<p>The grey crowned crane is closely related to the black crowned crane, 
  and the two species have sometimes been treated as the same species.
   The two are separable on the basis of genetic evidence, calls,
    plumage and bare parts, and all authorities treat them as
     different species today.</p>
<p>There are two subspecies. The East African B. r. gibbericeps (crested crane) occurs
   in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Uganda, of which it is 
   the national bird represented in its national flag, and Kenya to eastern South Africa.
    It has a larger area of bare red facial skin above the white patch than the smaller
     nominate species, B. r. regulorum (South African crowned crane), which breeds from
      Angola south to South Africa.</p>
<p>The grey crowned crane is approximately 1 m (3 ft 3 in) tall, weighs 3.5 kg (7.7 lb),
   and has a wingspan of 2 m (6 ft 7 in). Its body plumage is mainly grey. The wings are 
   predominantly white, but contain feathers with a range of colours, with a distinctive
   black patch at the very top. The head has a crown of stiff golden feathers. The sides
    of the face are white, and there is a bright red inflatable throat pouch. The bill
     is relatively short and grey, and the legs are black. They have long legs for
      wading through the grasses. The feet are large, yet slender, adapted for balance 
      rather than defence or grasping. The sexes are similar, although males tend to
       be slightly larger. Younger cranes are greyer than adults, with a feathered buff
        face.</p>
<p>This species and the black crowned crane are the only cranes that can roost in trees,
   because of a long hind toe that can grasp branches. This trait is assumed to be an
    ancestral trait among the cranes, which has been lost in the other subfamily.
     Crowned cranes also lack a coiled trachea and have loose plumage compared to
      the other cranes.</p>
<h1>White-tailed tropicbird</h1>
<hr>
<p>The white-tailed tropicbird (Phaethon lepturus) is a tropicbird. It is the smallest of
   three closely related seabirds of the tropical oceans and smallest member of the order
    Phaethontiformes. It is found in the tropical Atlantic, western Pacific and Indian
     Oceans. It also breeds on some Caribbean islands, and a few pairs have started
      nesting recently on Little Tobago, joining the red-billed tropicbird colony.
       In addition to the tropical Atlantic, it nests as far north as Bermuda,
       where it is locally called a "longtail".</p>
<h1>Steller's sea eagle</h1>

<hr>
<p>Steller's sea eagle (Haliaeetus pelagicus), also known as Pacific sea eagle or
   white-shouldered eagle, is a very large diurnal bird of prey in the family 
   Accipitridae. It was described first by Peter Simon Pallas in 1811.
    No subspecies are recognised. A sturdy eagle, it has dark brown plumage 
    with white wings and tail, a yellow beak, and yellow talons. Typically,
     it is the heaviest eagle in the world, at about 5 to 10 kg (11 to 22 lb),
      but in some standard measurements, may be ranked below the harpy eagle
       (Harpia harpyja) and the Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi).</p>
<p>The Steller's sea eagle is endemic to Northeast Asia, where it lives in Russia, Korea,
   Japan, China, and Taiwan. Steller's sea eagle lives in coastal northeastern Asia and
    mainly preys on fish and water birds. The Kamchatka Peninsula in Far Eastern Russia
     is known for its relatively large population of these birds; about 4,000 of these
      eagles live there. Steller's sea eagle is listed as vulnerable on the
       International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List (IUCN Red List)
        of threatened species. Steller's sea eagle females are bigger than males.</p>
<p>This species was described initially as Aquila pelagica by Prussian naturalist Peter
   Simon Pallas, in 1811. The species name is the Ancient Greek pelagos, "the open
    sea/ocean". Dutch naturalist Coenraad Jacob Temminck named it Falco leucopterus,
     "white winged eagle", in 1824, and Heinrich von Kittlitz called it Falco
      imperator in 1832. George Robert Gray moved the species into the genus 
      Haliaeetus in 1849.</p>
<div id="div id is 1">
<p>"Steller's sea eagle" has been designated the official name by the International
   Ornithologists' Union (IOU). It is named after the German naturalist,
    Georg Wilhelm Steller. It also is known as Steller's fish eagle, Pacific
     sea eagle, or white-shouldered eagle. In Russian, the eagle has been 
     called morskoi orel (sea eagle), pestryi morskoi orel (mottled sea eagle),
      or beloplechii orlan (white-shouldered eagle). In Japanese, it is called
      ō-washi (large eagle or great eagle). In Korean, the eagle is called 
      chamsuri (true eagle). In Mandarin, it is called hǔtóu hǎidiāo (tiger-headed 
      sea eagle).</p>
<P>A 1996 analysis of the cytochrome b gene of mitochondrial DNA showed that Steller's
  sea eagles diverged from a lineage that gave rise to the bald eagle and white-tailed
   eagle around 3-4 million years ago. All three of these species have yellow eyes,
    beaks, and talons, unlike their next-closest relative, Pallas's fish eagle.
